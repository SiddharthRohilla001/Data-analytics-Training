# 🗳️ Voting System Project

Welcome to the **Voting System Project**! 🎉 This project helps users check their eligibility to vote based on their age.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Marks users aged 18 to 64 as **eligible** voters.
- 👴 Recognizes users aged 65 and above as **eligible senior** voters.
- ❗ Validates input to handle invalid or negative ages gracefully.

## 🛠️ How to Use

2. When prompted, enter your age.
3. Read the message about your voting eligibility.

## 💻 Sample Usage
